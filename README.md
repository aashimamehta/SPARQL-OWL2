# SPARQL-OWL2
SPARQL OWL-2 Research Project.
This project is about data mining and detecting vulnerabilities in the projects. 
Using CodeOntology tool (OWL-2), I created RDF triples of the java projects. 
Then I wrote queries to extract information regarding security patterns from the projects. The way I did this is first deciding what security pattern I am looking for and then implementing the classes/subclasses/files that indicate the implementations of the pattern.
In the begining I tried focused on some major patterns like: Secure Sandbox, Secure Service Proxy, etc. But then focused my work on Secure Service Proxy, as it looked more relevant to the project. Then using the query and .nt files generatedfrom Codeontology tool we were able to detect patterns.
