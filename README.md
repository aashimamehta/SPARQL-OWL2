# SPARQL-OWL2
SPARQL OWL-2 Research Project
The project that I worked on is about data mining. 
Using CodeOntology tool (OWL-2) to create RDF triples of the java projects. 
Then I wrote queries to extract information about if the project has implemented any security patterns or not. 
Specifically, I wrote queries to detect Secure Proxy Design Pattern in the java project. Then using this query and .nt files generated
from Codeontology tool we were able to extract the vulnerabilities the project contained.
