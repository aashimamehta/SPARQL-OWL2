# SPARQL-OWL2
SPARQL OWL-2 Research Project.
This project is about data mining and detecting vulnerabilities in the projects. 
Using CodeOntology tool (OWL-2) to create RDF triples of the java projects. 
Then I wrote queries to extract information about if the project has implemented any security patterns or not. 
Specifically, I wrote queries to detect Secure Proxy Design Pattern in the java project. Then using this query and .nt files generated
from Codeontology tool we were able to extract the vulnerabilities the project contained.
